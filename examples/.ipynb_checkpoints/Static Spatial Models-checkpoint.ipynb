    "# How to Use Eir Spatial Models\n",

This tutorial will use the Hub model as an example, but the same principle applies for the Strong Infectous model. The details about the model can be found in Fujie & Odagaki's paper, cited in the Eir JOSS paper. You could also find details in the docs/ folder. "

    "## Synopsis of how these spatial models work\n",
    "Assume there are N separate individuals in a locality, confined to an LxL grid, with each person's location within the grid being randomly generated. These individuals do not change position, hence the \"static\" spatial model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To become infected, or leave the S compartment, we use a formula pulled from Fujie & Odagaki's paper. This formula is based on 3 variables: *r*, which represents the distance between the infectious person and susceptible person, *r0*, which is considered the \"spreading radius\" of the infectious person, where outside this radius, there is a 0% chance that the infectious person will spread it to the susceptible person outside the radius, and *w <sub>0* indicates the probability of an infectious person infecting a susceptible person 0 units away. It is better to simply look at the formula used in their article, as I still cannot figure out Markdown formatting. \n",
